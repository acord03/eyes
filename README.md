# Eyes
Cursor tracking animation exercise for class

In order to experience the project, all you have to do is boot it will detect your mouse's location relative to the window's bounds and adjust the location of the pupil of the eye accordingly to make the eyes look as if they are watching the cursor.

In the future, I plan on making the eyes close if you click on them as if they had been poked.
